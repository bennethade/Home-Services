                                        We automatically collect certain information when you use the Sabiworkers Platform. The categories of information we automatically collect and have collected, including in the last 12 months, are as follows:
                                        Service Use Data, including data about features you use, pages you visit, emails and advertisements you view, portions of the Sabiworkers Platform that you view and interact with, the time of day you browse, and your referring and exiting pages.
                                        Device Data, including data about the type of device or browser you use, your device’s operating system, your internet service provider, your device’s regional and language settings, and device identifiers such as IP address and Ad Id.

We may use Device Information to monitor the geographic regions from which Users navigate the Sabiworkers Platform, and for security and fraud prevention purposes. Use of any IP-masking technologies or similar technologies (like the TOR network) may render portions of the Sabiworkers Platform unavailable and are forbidden on the Sabiworkers Platform.
                                        Location Data, including imprecise location data (such as location derived from an IP address or data that indicates a city or postal code level), and, with your consent, precise location data (such as latitude/longitude data). When you visit the Sabiworkers Platform via a native mobile application, we use, with your consent when required under applicable law, GPS technology (or other similar technology) to determine your current location in order to determine the city you are located in and display a relevant location map. We will not share your current location obtained in this manner with other Users.
                                        Cookies and similar technologies are described in our Cookie Policy, which sets out the different categories of cookies and similar technologies that the Sabiworkers Platform uses and why we use them.

                                        Interest-Based Advertising. Ads are a standard part of user experience on the Internet, and Sabiworkers believes that targeted advertising enhances this experience. Sabiworkers and affiliate third parties may use cookies and other technologies to place ads where they believe interested Users will see them. In addition to banner ads, Sabiworkers may advertise products, companies and events that we think might interest you through the email address and/or phone number you provide. We may incorporate Tracking Technologies on the TaskRabbit Platform (including our website and emails) as well as into our ads displayed on other websites and services. Some of these Tracking Technologies may track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you (“Interest-Based Advertising”).
                                        For more information and to understand your choices regarding third-party ads, please see our Cookie Policy. Advertising and marketing is carried out as necessary for our legitimate interests in providing an engaging and relevant experience, promoting our services, and growing our business.
                                        Analytics and Market Analysis. Sabiworkers may analyze information (“Market Analysis”) as necessary for our legitimate interests in providing an engaging and relevant experience, and promoting and growing the Sabiworkers Platform.
                                        Sabiworkers uses information to offer services to Users who express an interest in these services, through a poll for example, or to Users who can be presumed to have an interest based on results from our Market Analysis. We do this as necessary for our legitimate interests in providing an engaging and relevant experience, promoting our services, and growing our business.
                                        Cell Phone Numbers:

If you would like more information about our policy, or how to opt out, please review the “Your Rights and Choices” section below or Section 9 of our Terms of Service. You may be liable for standard SMS and per-minute charges by your mobile carrier. Sabiworkers may also message you via push notifications (with your consent when required under applicable law), which you can opt-out of on your mobile device. Data rates may apply.
                                        Call recordings. Calls to or from Sabiworkers or its Third Party Agents may be monitored and recorded for the purposes of quality control and training. Such calls may contain Personal Information.

                                        Sabiworkers reserves the right to disclose Personal Information from both private and public areas of the Sabiworkers Platform in the absence of a court order, warrant, or subpoena, to the extent permitted by applicable law, if we are given reason to believe, in our sole discretion, that someone is causing injury to or interfering with the rights of Users, the general public, or Sabiworkers or its partners, parents or affiliates.
                                        It is our policy to provide notice to Users before producing their information in response to law enforcement requests unless (i) we are prohibited or otherwise constrained by law or court order from doing so, (ii) we have reason to believe the User’s account has been compromised such that the notice would go to the wrong person, or notice would otherwise be counterproductive or would create a risk to safety, or (iii) it is an emergency request and prior notice would be impractical (in which case we may provide notice after the fact).
                                        Merger or Acquisition. Sabiworkers reserves the right to share information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale, or any other type of acquisition or business combination of all or any portion of our assets, or transfer of all or a portion of our business to another business.
                                        Public Areas.

                                        <strong> 7. Your Rights and Choices</strong>
                                        You may opt-out of receiving promotional communications from us, including promotional communications related to the Sabiworkers Platform, and request the removal of your Personal Information from our databases, or deactivate your account, by logging on to the Site or App and clicking on the “Account” tab, or by contacting us.

                                        So that we may protect the integrity of the Sabiworkers Platform, there are certain pieces of information, such as your age, that you cannot alter yourself. For example, since children under the age of majority in their jurisdiction of residence are not allowed to register as Users, we need to take reasonable measures to preserve the accuracy of our Users' ages. You may contact us at privacy@sabiworkers.com if there is a need to make a correction to such data. Please see Section 11, Children’s Privacy, for more details.
                                        Promotional Communications. You can opt out of receiving promotional communications from Sabiworkers via the Account tab in your Profile. In addition, you can opt out of email marketing by clicking on the unsubscribe link in any message. You can opt out of promotional communications from Sabiworkers sent via text message at any time by following the instructions provided in those messages to text the word "STOP".

If you opt-out of only certain communications, other subscription communications may continue. Even if you opt-out of receiving promotional communications, Sabiworkers will continue to send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, Tasks, transactions, servicing, or Sabiworkers’s ongoing business relationship with you. If you receive unsolicited promotional communications from a Sabiworkers domain, please let us know here.

                                        <strong> 8. Sabiworkers's Information Retention Policy</strong>
                                        We retain personal data for as long as you are a User in order to meet our contractual obligations to you, and for such longer period as may be in our legitimate interests and to comply with our legal obligations (see Exhibit A for exemplar document retention periods). We may also retain data from which you cannot directly be identified, for example where stored against a randomly-generated identifier so we know the data relates to a single User, but we cannot tell who that User is. We use this kind of data for research purposes and to help us develop and improve our services, and we take appropriate measures to ensure you cannot be re-identified from this data.
                                        <br><br> 
                                        <strong> 9. Sabiworkers’s Security of Collected Information</strong>
                                        Your Sabiworkers account is password-protected so that only you and authorized Sabiworkers staff have access to your account information. In order to maintain this protection, do not give your password to anyone. Also, if you share a computer, you should sign out of your Sabiworkers account and close the browser window before someone else logs on. This will help protect your information entered on public terminals from disclosure to third parties.
                                        Sabiworkers implements and maintains reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security safeguards to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Sabiworkers has staff dedicated to maintaining this Privacy Policy and other privacy initiatives, periodically reviewing security, and making sure that every Sabiworkers employee is aware of our security practices. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of information about you.

                                        <strong> 10. Notification of Changes</strong>
                                        Sabiworkers Privacy Policy is periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary.

                                        <strong> 11. Children’s Privacy</strong>
                                        This service is intended for a general audience, and is not directed at children under 13 years of age. In certain jurisdictions, this minimum age may be higher. Please check the Jurisdiction-specific Provisions below for more information.
                                        We do not knowingly gather personal information (as defined by the Nigerian Children’s Privacy Protection Act, or “COPPA”) in a manner not permitted by COPPA. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that we have collected information from your child in a manner not permitted by law, please let us know by contacting us here. We will remove the data.
                                        We do not knowingly collect or “sell” the Personal Information of minors under 18 years old.

                                        <strong> 12. Contacting Us</strong>
                                        If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the manner in which we or our Third-Party Agents treat your Personal Information, the practices of the Site, your dealings with the Sabiworkers Platform, or if you have technical problems, you may contact us here.
                                        Sabiworkers's staff will respond to all mail or email from Users with questions about privacy, including the types of Personal Information stored on the Sabiworkers databases, and requests to know, delete or rectify such Personal Information.
                                        Sabiworkers expressly disclaims any liability that may arise should any other individuals obtain the information you submit to the Sabiworkers Platform.
                                        Sabiworkers’s Security of Collected Information. While Sabiworkers will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of all Personal Information, we expressly disclaim any liability for any unauthorized access to or use of our secure servers and/or any and all Personal Information stored therein, and you agree to hold Sabiworkers harmless for any damages that may result therefrom. If you have any further questions on this issue, please refer to the Terms of Service.
                                        Sabiworkers does not generally sell information as the term “sell” is traditionally understood. However, to the extent “sale” under the CCPA is interpreted to include advertising technology activities such as those disclosed in Section 5, Sabiworkers’s Use of Information, as a “sale,” we will comply with applicable law as to such activity.
                                        Sabiworkers discloses the following categories of information for commercial purposes:
                                         Commercial Information;
                                         Demographic Data;
                                         Location Data;
                                         Identifiers;
                                         Inferences; and
                                         Internet activity.
                                        We use and partner with different types of entities to assist with our daily operations and manage the Sabiworkers Platform. Please review Section 6, Information Sharing, for more detail about the parties with which we share Personal Information.
